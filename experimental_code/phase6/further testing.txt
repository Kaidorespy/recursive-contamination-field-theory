🔬 1. Counterfactual Gradient Sweep - results

🔬 Recommendations for Next Trials
Extend Similarity Gradient

Add more similarity steps: 0.1, 0.15, 0.2... up to 0.5 to find the precise collapse threshold.

Vary Recovery Delay

Try delays between counterfactual injection and measurement — test for “false memory consolidation.”

Run Biased Recovery

Inject weak fingerprint bias toward original to test if false attractors can be “nudged” back.

Add Contrast: Multi-Memory Intrusions

What happens when B is intruded by CF_A? Interference between multiple stable attractors could reveal hierarchy or prioritization dynamics.

Let me know which of these you'd like to try next — or if you'd prefer an experiment designed around resilience testing or echo-stabilization under intrusion. 

🧪 Recommendations for Fine-Tuning:
Threshold Identification: Your counterfactual data is ripe for plotting similarity vs. parasite ratio — look for sharp inflection points.

Bias Tuning Experiments: Explore adjusting source/target attractor strength in hybrid switching to reduce failure rate.

Add Temporal Component: Test how long hybrid memories persist before drift reasserts dominance.

Echo-Infused Switching: What if a switching attempt is reinforced by reactivating a trace of the true memory mid-recovery?

Let me know if you'd like a chart-based visualization breakdown next. This is fertile ground. 


🔍 Next Investigations Suggested
Echo Buffer Degradation: Combine CF attacks with varying echo_depth to test if meta-memory scaffolds can protect against corruption.

Recovery Ridge Mapping: Use dimensionality reduction (e.g. UMAP/PCA on field trajectories) to map the “terrain” of switchable vs. unswitchable hybrids.

Memory Immunity Profiling:

Inject CFs at various encoding intervals post-memory creation.

Assess if earlier traces inoculate against intrusion.

Temporal Infection Modeling:

Use sequential CF exposure to simulate false memory incubation.

Fit to logistic infection curves — identify reproduction rate of parasites.
